# Text File Age Extractor

This Python script reads a text file containing names and ages, extracts the relevant information, and calculates the total sum of ages.

## Features
- Reads formatted data from `data.txt`
- Parses names and their corresponding ages
- Displays each name with age
- Calculates and prints the total sum of ages

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- A `data.txt` file in the same directory

### Example `data.txt`
```
John Adams            25
Patrick Henry         30
Thomas Jefferson      19
